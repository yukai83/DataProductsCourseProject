Welcome to the "Choose the Best Car to Buy" app, developed for fufillment of the Developing Data Products Course. This app helps people to choose the best car that they want to buy, based on their car preferences using mtcars dataset, from [R] 

This app asks you for the following information before it filters the dataset of cars based on your requirements:

  (1) Minimum Miles per Gallon requirement of the car,
  (2) Gross Horsepower of the car,
  (3) Number of Cylinders the car engine has (4, 6 or 8),
  (4) Transmission of the engine (Automatic or Manual),
  (5) Approximate number of miles that the car would be driven per week.

A table will appear, showing the cars with the filters applied based on your requirements. The table can be sorted based on the variable you want.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/yukai83/DataProductsCourseProject).
